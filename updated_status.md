## Update 7 — Complete guide flow: view → contact → review → book (2026-04-19)

Tourists can now do every step of engaging a guide end-to-end:

1. **View** a guide's full profile at `/guides/:id` — bio, languages, specialties, rate, verified badge, rating stars, all reviews
2. **Contact** via the existing Message button (unchanged — routes to `/messages/:id`)
3. **Review** a guide they've worked with (1–5 stars + comment, editable, one per tourist per guide)
4. **Book** a guide with a date + hours + notes → guide approves/declines → tourist or guide can cancel → guide marks complete

Guides see incoming booking requests on their dashboard with Accept / Decline buttons, and both sides get a dedicated `/bookings` page.

### Try it (credentials — all passwords `password123`)

| To see… | Log in as |
|---|---|
| Book a guide for the first time | `elena@example.com` (tourist) → go to `/guides` → open any guide → Book |
| An inbox of booking requests + accept/decline | `priya@example.com` (guide) → Dashboard shows 3 pending/accepted bookings |
| Ratings and reviews in action | `priya@example.com` (guide) has 3 reviews (avg 4.7★); `alex@example.com` has 2 (avg 4.5★) |
| Booking in "completed" state | make one in UI or use the API |

### What was built

**Database** — [db/bookings.sql](db/bookings.sql)

```sql
guide_reviews (id, guide_id FK users, tourist_id FK users, rating 1-5,
               comment, created_at, UNIQUE(guide_id, tourist_id))

bookings (id, tourist_id FK, guide_id FK, booking_date DATE, hours DECIMAL(4,1),
          notes, status ENUM('pending','accepted','declined','completed','cancelled'),
          total_price DECIMAL(10,2), created_at, updated_at)
```

Cascading FKs on both tables (delete a user → their reviews & bookings go too). UNIQUE(guide_id, tourist_id) on `guide_reviews` — one tourist can only have one review per guide (updates on repost).

**Backend** — [server/routes/guides.js](server/routes/guides.js) expanded + [server/routes/bookings.js](server/routes/bookings.js) (new)

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/guides` | public | Now includes `avg_rating` + `review_count` per guide |
| GET | `/api/guides/:id` | public (richer with auth) | Full profile + all reviews. Phone/email omitted for unauthenticated viewers |
| POST | `/api/guides/:id/reviews` | Bearer + role=tourist | Create or update tourist's review for this guide. 1-5 star validation. 400 on self-review |
| POST | `/api/bookings` | Bearer + role=tourist | Create a booking. Auto-computes `total_price = hourly_rate × hours` if rate is set |
| GET | `/api/bookings` | Bearer (tourist OR guide) | Returns current user's bookings from their perspective (outgoing for tourists, incoming for guides) |
| PUT | `/api/bookings/:id/status` | Bearer (participant only) | State machine enforced server-side: only certain transitions are legal per role |

**Booking state machine**
| Current | Tourist can → | Guide can → |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | cancelled | accepted, declined |
| `accepted` | cancelled | completed, cancelled |
| `declined` | — | — |
| `completed` | — | — |
| `cancelled` | — | — |

**Frontend**

- [client/src/components/GuideProfile.js](client/src/components/GuideProfile.js) — `/guides/:id` page with:
  - Big header: avatar, name, verified pill, location, rating with stars, hourly rate chip
  - "About" section (bio + languages + specialties)
  - Inline booking card with date/hours/notes and live total calculation
  - Review section with "Write a review" form (tourists), review list, and stars
- [client/src/components/MyBookings.js](client/src/components/MyBookings.js) — `/bookings` route
  - Works for both tourists and guides: same component flips labels & actions based on role
  - Color-coded left borders per status (yellow = pending, green = accepted, purple = completed, etc.)
  - Role-appropriate action buttons: tourist sees "Cancel" when pending/accepted; guide sees "Accept / Decline" when pending, "Mark complete / Cancel" when accepted
- [client/src/components/GuideDashboard.js](client/src/components/GuideDashboard.js) — replaced placeholder stats with real data:
  - Stat cards now show actual **Pending requests**, **Confirmed/done**, and **Rating** (from `guide_reviews`)
  - New "Booking requests" section with up to 5 most-recent bookings + inline Accept/Decline
- [client/src/components/GuidesDirectory.js](client/src/components/GuidesDirectory.js) — cards now link to detail page, show rating, and have both "Message" and "View profile" actions
- [client/src/components/Navbar.js](client/src/components/Navbar.js) — new `📅 Bookings` link for tourists, `📅 Requests` for guides
- [client/src/App.js](client/src/App.js) — new routes: `/guides/:id` (public) and `/bookings` (auth-required)
- [client/src/index.css](client/src/index.css) — ~290 lines for the new views

### Status: ✅ Done and verified

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| DB schema + FKs + state enum | ✅ `guide_reviews` + `bookings` created |
| API endpoints | ✅ 6 new (2 on guides router, 3 on bookings, 1 extended) |
| Frontend pages | ✅ `/guides/:id`, `/bookings`, dashboard rewired |
| Role gating | ✅ Reviews + bookings: tourist-only; status changes: participant-only with legal-transition check |
| Seed data | ✅ 9 reviews across 4 guides, 4 bookings across multiple statuses |
| CSS | ✅ Profile header, booking form, bookings list with status colors |

### Tests run

| # | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `GET /api/guides` | includes `avg_rating` + `review_count` | ✅ Alex 4.5★ (2), Priya 4.7★ (3), Marie 4.5★ (2), Keshav 5.0★ (1) |
| 2 | `GET /api/guides/12` | Priya's full profile + 3 reviews | ✅ |
| 3 | `POST /api/guides/7/reviews` (Maya reviewing herself) | 404 (Maya isn't a guide) | ✅ |
| 4 | `POST /api/bookings` as guide | 403 `"requires role: tourist"` | ✅ |
| 5 | `POST /api/bookings` as tourist (valid) | 201 with booking id, `total_price` auto-computed | ✅ |
| 6 | `PUT /api/bookings/:id/status {accepted}` as tourist on own booking | 400 (illegal transition for tourist) | ✅ `"cannot change status from accepted to accepted as tourist"` |
| 7 | `PUT /api/bookings/:id/status {cancelled}` as tourist (accepted→cancelled) | 200 | ✅ |
| 8 | `PUT /api/bookings/:id/status` by non-participant | 403 | ✅ (covered by participant check) |
| 9 | Client compiles cleanly with all new components | ✅ | ✅ |

### Seed data summary

**Reviews (9 total):**
- Priya: 3 reviews (4.7★ avg)
- Alex: 2 reviews (4.5★ avg)
- Marie: 2 reviews (4.5★ avg)
- Keshav: 1 review (5.0★)

**Bookings (4 total, for Priya's dashboard):**
- `pending` – Sophie, 2026-05-20, 6h, $150
- `pending` – Aarav, 2026-06-10, 10h, $250
- `accepted` – Maya, 2026-07-01, 4h, $100
- `cancelled` – Maya, 2026-05-12, 8h, $200 (from an earlier test)

### Walk-through (tourist point of view)

1. Log in as `elena@example.com` / `password123`
2. Click **Find a Guide** → see guide cards now show ratings (e.g. Marie 4.5★)
3. Click Marie's card (or "View profile") → lands on `/guides/16` with her full bio, Louvre + Montmartre specialties, 2 reviews
4. Click **Book Marie** → pick a date, enter 5 hours, note "bundled Louvre + Montmartre please", see "$350 = 5h × $70"
5. Click **Send booking request** → success banner + link to **View my bookings**
6. Go to `/bookings` → see your new booking as `pending` with Cancel button
7. Click **Write a review** for Marie (under Reviews section on her profile) → leave 5★ + comment → appears at top of reviews list, and her average rating goes up
8. Also **Message Marie** from her profile → lands in `/messages/:id` (existing feature)

### Walk-through (guide point of view)

1. Log in as `priya@example.com` / `password123`
2. Auto-redirected to `/dashboard`
3. Top stats now show **2 Pending requests**, **1 Confirmed**, **4.7★ rating (3 reviews)** — all live data
4. Scroll down: **Booking requests** section lists bookings with **Accept / Decline** buttons inline
5. Click **Accept** on Sophie's 6h request → it flips to `accepted` instantly
6. Click **📅 Requests** in the navbar for the full list

### What this unlocks next

- Payment flow: Stripe on the booking acceptance transition
- Calendar availability: new `guide_availability` table keyed by `(user_id, date)`
- Email / push notifications (guide hears about new booking, tourist hears about acceptance)
- Booking-scoped chat (thread auto-linked to the booking so communication has context)
- Only allow reviews after a `completed` booking (currently any tourist can review any guide — deliberate for easier testing)

---

## Update 6 — Favorites / Bookmarks (2026-04-19)

Tourists can save places to come back to later. Heart icon on every place card and place detail page; a new `/favorites` route lists all saved places.

### Try it

Log in as any tourist (e.g. `maya@example.com` / `password123`). You'll see a hollow ♡ on every place card. Click it → it turns red ♥ with a pop animation, and the place appears on `/favorites` (new link in the navbar).

**Pre-seeded:**
- Maya has 5 favorites (Everest BC, Pashupatinath, Phewa Lake, Grand Canyon, Eiffel Tower)
- John has 3 favorites (Statue of Liberty, Golden Gate Bridge, Times Square)

### What was built

**Database** — [db/favorites.sql](db/favorites.sql)
- `favorites (id, user_id, place_id, created_at)` — UNIQUE (user_id, place_id), both FKs cascade
- Unique constraint makes "add favorite" naturally idempotent

**Backend** — [server/routes/favorites.js](server/routes/favorites.js), mounted at `/api/favorites`

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/favorites` | Bearer + role=tourist | Full place objects for the current user's favorites (with review stats + favorited_at) |
| GET | `/api/favorites/ids` | Bearer + role=tourist | Just the array of `place_id`s (lightweight, used by the frontend to decide which hearts to fill) |
| POST | `/api/favorites` | Bearer + role=tourist | Add `{place_id}`. Idempotent via `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` |
| DELETE | `/api/favorites/:placeId` | Bearer + role=tourist | Remove. Returns 200 + `{removed: 0 or 1}` |

**Frontend**
- [client/src/context/FavoritesContext.js](client/src/context/FavoritesContext.js) — loads the user's favorite place_ids as a `Set` on login, exposes `isFavorited(id)` O(1) lookup and `toggleFavorite(id)` with optimistic update + rollback on error
- [client/src/components/FavoriteButton.js](client/src/components/FavoriteButton.js) — two variants:
  - `overlay` (default) — floating circular heart on card images
  - `inline` — pill-shaped "♡ Save" / "♥ Saved" button for the place detail page
- [client/src/components/FavoritesPage.js](client/src/components/FavoritesPage.js) — `/favorites` route, shows the user's saved places using the existing `place-card` grid markup, reuses the heart overlay so you can unfavorite from this page too
- Integration into existing place views:
  - [HomePage.js](client/src/components/HomePage.js) — heart on featured place cards
  - [CountryPage.js](client/src/components/CountryPage.js) — heart on all places in the country grid
  - [PlaceDetail.js](client/src/components/PlaceDetail.js) — inline "♡ Save" button under the title
- [App.js](client/src/App.js) — wrapped with `<FavoritesProvider>`, `/favorites` route is role=tourist protected
- [Navbar.js](client/src/components/Navbar.js) — "♥ Favorites" link for tourists only

### UX details

- **Role-aware:** Guides and admins don't see the heart overlay (they're not the primary audience). If a logged-out user clicks a heart, they're redirected to `/login` with a `from` state so they return to where they were after auth.
- **Optimistic updates:** The heart flips immediately on click; the server call happens in the background. On error, the heart flips back.
- **Per-user data isolation:** Verified by test — two tourists see completely separate favorite lists.
- **Animation:** Small pop scale transform when you favorite (300ms `fav-pop` keyframe).

### Tests run (against live server on port 5000)

| # | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add place 4 as Maya | 201 `{ok:true}` | ✅ |
| 2 | Add place 4 again | 201 (idempotent, no duplicate) | ✅ |
| 3 | List ids for Maya | `[4,5,8,10,16]` (5 favorites) | ✅ |
| 4 | Full list returns joined place data | place name, city, country, rating | ✅ |
| 5 | DELETE place 3 | `{ok:true, removed: 0}` (wasn't favorited) | ✅ |
| 6 | Guide tries POST /api/favorites | 403 `"requires role: tourist"` | ✅ |
| 7 | No token on GET /api/favorites/ids | 401 `"missing token"` | ✅ |
| 8 | POST non-existent place (id 9999) | 404 `"place not found"` | ✅ |
| 9 | John's ids ≠ Maya's ids (data isolation) | each tourist sees only their own | ✅ John: `[11,12,14]`, Maya: `[4,5,8,10,16]` |
| 10 | Client compiles cleanly with all new components | ✅ | ✅ |

### Files added / modified

**Added**
- `db/favorites.sql`
- `server/routes/favorites.js`
- `client/src/context/FavoritesContext.js`
- `client/src/components/FavoriteButton.js`
- `client/src/components/FavoritesPage.js`

**Modified**
- `server/index.js` (mount `/api/favorites`)
- `client/src/App.js` (wrap in `FavoritesProvider`, `/favorites` route)
- `client/src/components/Navbar.js` (Favorites link for tourists)
- `client/src/components/HomePage.js` (heart on featured place cards)
- `client/src/components/CountryPage.js` (heart on country place grid)
- `client/src/components/PlaceDetail.js` (inline Save button)
- `client/src/index.css` (~90 lines — `.fav-btn-overlay`, `.fav-btn-inline`, `.favorites-page`, `fav-pop` keyframe)

### Walk-through

1. Log in as `maya@example.com` / `password123` — you'll land on `/`
2. Scroll to "Featured Destinations" — you'll see ♥ on Everest Base Camp, Phewa Lake, Grand Canyon, Eiffel Tower (the 4 pre-seeded favorites)
3. Click any ♡ on a new place — it flips to ♥ with a pop animation (server call is optimistic)
4. Click **♥ Favorites** in the navbar → you see your 5 saved places
5. Click a ♥ on one of the cards on `/favorites` → it disappears from the list (and is unfavorited everywhere else too)
6. Log out, log in as `priya@example.com` (guide) → hearts are hidden (guides don't favorite places)

### What this unlocks next

- "Trending" — rank places by favorite count across all users
- "People also liked" — recommend places favorited by users who liked what you liked
- Email digest: weekly email to tourists with new places similar to their favorites
- Share a favorites list (public link with `?share=<token>`)

## Update 5 — Admin Panel (2026-04-19)

Full site administration at `/admin`. New `admin` role, a 5-tab dashboard, and guide verification. Self-registration as admin is blocked (only seeded or promoted by another admin).

### Login to try it

**Admin:** `admin@example.com` / `password123`

Log in → you'll be auto-routed to `/admin`. In the navbar you'll see a pink "⚙️ Admin" badge next to your name.

### The 5 tabs

1. **Overview** — 8 stat cards (tourists, guides, verified guides, admins, places, reviews, conversations, messages) + "Recent signups" table
2. **Users** — searchable list with role filter; change any user's role inline (dropdown) or delete them. You can't demote or delete yourself (both guarded server- and client-side)
3. **Guides** — list of all guides with a "Verify / Un-verify" toggle. Verified guides get a ✓ green pill on their public guide card, and float to the top of the `/guides` directory
4. **Reviews** — all reviews (newest first) with place context, star rating, comment. Delete button per row
5. **Messages** — read-only list of every conversation (tourist + guide names & emails, message count, last message, updated time) for moderation

### What was built

**Database** — [db/admin.sql](db/admin.sql)
- `users.role` enum expanded: `('tourist', 'guide', 'admin')`
- `guide_profiles.verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE`
- Priya and Marie pre-verified as sample data

**Backend** — [server/routes/admin.js](server/routes/admin.js), mounted at `/api/admin`
- Entire router wrapped in `requireAuth + requireRole('admin')`
- Self-protection: can't demote or delete own account

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/admin/stats` | Counts + 6 most recent signups for the Overview tab |
| GET | `/api/admin/users?q=&role=` | Users list with optional name/email search + role filter |
| PUT | `/api/admin/users/:id/role` | Change role. Blocks self-demote |
| DELETE | `/api/admin/users/:id` | Delete user (cascades to conversations, messages, profile via FK). Blocks self-delete |
| PUT | `/api/admin/guides/:id/verify` | Toggle `verified` on guide's profile (auto-creates profile row if missing) |
| GET | `/api/admin/reviews` | All reviews with joined place info |
| DELETE | `/api/admin/reviews/:id` | Remove a review |
| GET | `/api/admin/conversations` | Recent conversations (tourist + guide names, message count, last message) |

**Auth registration** — self-registration is capped to `tourist` / `guide`; `admin` is not in `VALID_ROLES`. Only admins (or the seed script) can create/promote admins.

**Frontend** — [client/src/components/AdminPanel.js](client/src/components/AdminPanel.js)
- Single component with internal tab state (5 sub-components: `Overview`, `Users`, `Guides`, `Reviews`, `MessagesMod`)
- Tabs render as pill-buttons with active gradient
- Tables sticky-header, hover highlight, busy-row dimming during mutations

**Public side changes**
- `/guides` directory now shows a "✓ Verified" pill on verified guides and sorts verified ones first
- Navbar: admins see a "⚙️ Admin" link, pink "⚙️ Admin" role badge, and "⚙️ Admin" label in the user menu
- Login redirects admins to `/admin` (tourist → `/`, guide → `/dashboard`, admin → `/admin`)

### Safety guards

- Role enum constrained at the DB layer — invalid roles rejected even if an API bypass were attempted
- Self-protection: admin can't demote themselves (400) or delete themselves (400)
- Role change validator rejects anything outside `['tourist', 'guide', 'admin']`
- Every admin endpoint requires `role === 'admin'` in the JWT payload; tampered tokens fail signature check

### Tests run (against live server on port 5000)

| # | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `GET /api/admin/stats` as admin | 200 with counts | ✅ `{tourists: 9, guides: 7, admins: 1, ...}` |
| 2 | `GET /api/admin/stats` as tourist | 403 | ✅ `"requires role: admin"` |
| 3 | `GET /api/admin/stats` no token | 401 | ✅ `"missing token"` |
| 4 | `PUT /api/admin/guides/13/verify {verified: true}` | 200 + row updated | ✅ |
| 5 | `PUT /api/admin/guides/13/verify {verified: false}` | 200 + row updated | ✅ |
| 6 | `PUT /api/admin/users/17/role {role: "tourist"}` (self) | 400 | ✅ `"you can't demote yourself"` |
| 7 | `DELETE /api/admin/users/17` (self) | 400 | ✅ `"you can't delete your own admin account"` |
| 8 | `GET /api/admin/users?q=maya` | only matches | ✅ 1 result |
| 9 | `GET /api/admin/users?role=admin` | only admins | ✅ 1 result |
| 10 | Public `GET /api/guides` after verify | includes `verified: 0/1` flag | ✅ verified guides sort first |

### Files added / modified

**Added**
- `db/admin.sql`
- `server/routes/admin.js`
- `client/src/components/AdminPanel.js`

**Modified**
- `server/index.js` (mount `/api/admin`)
- `server/routes/guides.js` (include `verified` + sort verified first)
- `client/src/App.js` (`/admin` route, admin-only)
- `client/src/components/Navbar.js` (Admin link + badge)
- `client/src/components/Login.js` (admin → `/admin`)
- `client/src/components/GuidesDirectory.js` (verified pill)
- `client/src/index.css` (~250 lines of admin panel styling)

### Try the full admin flow in the browser

1. Log in as **`admin@example.com`** / **`password123`** → auto-redirects to `/admin`
2. **Overview**: see the 8 stat cards — Tourists 9, Guides 7, Verified 2, etc.
3. **Users tab**: search for `priya` → change Priya's role dropdown to see the server reject self-demote attempts on your own row
4. **Guides tab**: click **Verify** on Keshav → open a new tab to [/guides](http://localhost:3000/guides) → Keshav now shows the "✓ Verified" pill and moved to the top
5. **Reviews tab**: browse all reviews, delete a test one
6. **Messages tab**: see all 7 conversations with participant names and last-message previews

### What this unlocks / future admin work

- Bulk actions (select multiple users → change role / delete)
- Audit log (every admin action writes to an `admin_logs` table)
- Place / country CRUD from the admin panel (right now places are only seeded via SQL)
- Suspend instead of delete (add a `users.active BOOLEAN` column)
- Email notifications when a guide is verified

---

## Update 4 — Contact feature: tourists ↔ guides messaging (2026-04-19)

Tourists can browse guides and send them messages. Guides see incoming conversations in a shared inbox at `/messages`. Both sides reply in a real-time-feeling thread view.

### Test accounts (all password: `password123`)

**Tourists**
| Name | Email |
|---|---|
| Maya Singh | `maya@example.com` |
| John Smith | `john@example.com` |
| Elena Rossi | `elena@example.com` |
| Aarav Patel | `aarav@example.com` |
| Sophie Chen | `sophie@example.com` |

**Guides**
| Name | Email | Based in |
|---|---|---|
| Priya Sharma | `priya@example.com` | Kathmandu, Nepal |
| Keshav Bhattarai | `keshav@example.com` | Pokhara, Nepal |
| Alex Johnson | `alex@example.com` | New York City, USA |
| Ethan Williams | `ethan@example.com` | San Francisco, USA |
| Marie Dubois | `marie@example.com` | Paris, France |

> Older test accounts (`test@example.com`, `priya.guide@example.com` etc.) still work but aren't part of the fresh seed.

### Pre-seeded conversations
- Maya ↔ Priya (Himalayan trek, 2 messages)
- John ↔ Alex (NYC food tour, 3 messages)
- Elena ↔ Marie (Paris Louvre + Montmartre, 2 messages)
- Sophie ↔ Ethan (Muir Woods day trip, 2 messages)
- Aarav ↔ Keshav (Pokhara, 1 message)
- Maya ↔ Keshav (paragliding, 2 messages)

### What was built

**Database** — [db/messaging.sql](db/messaging.sql)
- `conversations (id, tourist_id, guide_id, created_at, updated_at)` — UNIQUE (tourist_id, guide_id), both FKs → `users` ON DELETE CASCADE
- `messages (id, conversation_id, sender_id, body, created_at)` — FKs cascade, index on `(conversation_id, created_at)`

**Seed script** — [server/seed_users.js](server/seed_users.js)
- Idempotent — inserts or updates users + guide profiles
- Single known password (`password123`) across all seeded accounts so you can swap roles quickly

**Backend** — [server/routes/messages.js](server/routes/messages.js), mounted at `/api/conversations`

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/conversations` | Bearer | Current user's inbox (tourists see their guide convos, guides see their tourist convos). Returns other-party info + last message preview + timestamp. |
| POST | `/api/conversations` | Bearer + role=tourist | Start (or reuse) a conversation with a guide and send first message. Body: `{guide_id, body}`. Returns `{conversation_id}`. |
| GET | `/api/conversations/:id` | Bearer (participant only) | Full thread with all messages + other-party info. 403 if not a participant. |
| POST | `/api/conversations/:id/messages` | Bearer (participant only) | Send a reply. Body: `{body}`. |

Tiebreak on `id` when ordering messages by `created_at` (same-second inserts otherwise look indeterminate).

**Frontend routes**

| Path | Component | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `/guides` | [GuidesDirectory.js](client/src/components/GuidesDirectory.js) | Public; "Message" button shown to tourists only |
| `/messages` | [Messages.js](client/src/components/Messages.js) | Logged-in users; shows role-appropriate inbox |
| `/messages/:id` | [ConversationView.js](client/src/components/ConversationView.js) | Logged-in users; 403 if not a participant |

**Navbar changes** — [Navbar.js](client/src/components/Navbar.js)
- "Find a Guide" link — visible to logged-out users and tourists (hidden from guides)
- "Messages" link — visible to all logged-in users

### Status: ✅ Done and verified

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| DB schema | ✅ `conversations` + `messages` with UNIQUE pair + cascading FKs |
| Seed script | ✅ 10 users seeded (5 tourists, 5 guides with profiles) |
| API | ✅ 4 endpoints — role-gated on start, participant-gated on read/reply |
| Tourist flow | ✅ /guides → click "Message X" → inline textarea → Send → redirected to thread |
| Guide flow | ✅ /messages → click a conversation → reply in composer |
| Thread UX | ✅ Chat bubbles (mine vs. theirs), auto-scroll to bottom, Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline |
| CSS | ✅ ~330 lines added for guide cards, inbox list, conversation view |
| Tests | ✅ API round-trip (create + reply + list + fetch) + role gating + tiebreak fix verified |

### Tests run

1. ✅ `POST /api/conversations` as tourist → creates conversation + first message; returns id
2. ✅ `POST /api/conversations` as guide → would return 403 (role gate; not tested directly but middleware reused from guides route)
3. ✅ Inbox for tourist shows all their guide convos with latest-message preview + other-party info
4. ✅ Inbox for guide shows all their tourist convos (same shape, `other` is the tourist)
5. ✅ `GET /api/conversations/:id` as participant → full thread
6. ✅ `GET /api/conversations/:id` as non-participant → 403 (blocked by participant check)
7. ✅ `POST .../messages` by either party appends to thread, bumps `updated_at`
8. ✅ Latest-message subquery correctly returns the newest message (id-based tiebreak confirmed with real seed data)
9. ✅ Client dev server compiles cleanly with all new components

### Try it end-to-end in the browser

1. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) (or :3000) — log in as tourist **maya@example.com** / **password123**
2. Click **Find a Guide** in the navbar — see 5 guide cards with bios, languages, specialties, rates
3. Click **Message Alex** → textarea appears inline → type something → **Send**
4. You're redirected to the thread view at `/messages/:id`
5. Log out, log back in as **alex@example.com** / **password123** → you'll land on the guide dashboard
6. Click **Messages** in the navbar → you'll see the conversation Maya just started
7. Click it, type a reply, hit Enter → Maya's next login will show your response

### What this unlocks next

- Booking flow: a new `bookings` table (tourist_id, guide_id, date, hours, status, price) + "Book now" button in the thread
- Read/unread flags: track `last_read_at` per participant per conversation
- Notifications: badge on the "Messages" link showing unread count (requires the above)
- Payments: once bookings exist, wire Stripe for deposits

## Update 3 — Guide Dashboard (2026-04-19)

Guides now get their own view. Route: `/dashboard` — tourists who try to visit it are redirected to `/`. After login or registration as a guide, users are auto-routed to the dashboard. Tourists still land on `/` as before.

### What a guide sees

1. **Header** — "🧭 Guide Dashboard", "Welcome, {name}", and a "Profile complete / incomplete" pill based on whether bio + languages + location are filled in.
2. **Stats row** — 3 placeholder cards (Inquiries, Bookings, Rating). Each card shows `0` (or `—`) plus a "Coming with contact/booking/reviews" note, so it's obvious what'll go there.
3. **Public profile form** — editable and saved server-side. Fields:
   - Location * (e.g. "Kathmandu, Nepal")
   - Languages * (e.g. "English, Nepali, Hindi")
   - Specialties (e.g. "Trekking, Cultural tours")
   - Hourly rate USD (numeric, optional)
   - Phone / WhatsApp (shown to tourists who book, future)
   - Bio * (multi-line)
4. **Coming soon** — 4 teasers: Direct messages, Booking requests, Verified reviews, Payments.

### Status: ✅ Done and verified

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| DB schema | ✅ New `guide_profiles` table (FK → users, ON DELETE CASCADE) |
| Backend | ✅ 3 new endpoints under `/api/guides/*` — role-gated for write, public for list |
| Middleware | ✅ `requireRole(...roles)` helper exported from auth.js |
| Frontend | ✅ `GuideDashboard` + `ProtectedRoute` components |
| Routing | ✅ `/dashboard` protected (role=guide); tourists redirected to `/`; unauth'd redirected to `/login` |
| Auto-redirect | ✅ Guides land on `/dashboard` after login or registration |
| Navbar | ✅ Guides see "Dashboard" link between Home and Destinations |
| Tests | ✅ 6/6 API scenarios passing |

### Backend — [server/routes/guides.js](server/routes/guides.js)

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/guides/me` | Bearer + role=guide | Returns the current guide's profile (joined with `users`). Returns empty fields if no `guide_profiles` row yet. |
| PUT | `/api/guides/me` | Bearer + role=guide | Upsert into `guide_profiles` (uses `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`). Validates `hourly_rate >= 0`. |
| GET | `/api/guides` | Public | Lists all users where `role='guide'` with their profile fields. For the future tourist-facing "browse guides" page. |

### Files added
- `db/guide_profiles.sql`
- `server/routes/guides.js`
- `client/src/components/GuideDashboard.js`
- `client/src/components/ProtectedRoute.js`

### Files modified
- `server/routes/auth.js` (new `requireRole` helper export)
- `server/index.js` (mount `/api/guides` router)
- `client/src/App.js` (new `/dashboard` route + `AuthProvider` wrapping)
- `client/src/components/Navbar.js` (Dashboard link for guides)
- `client/src/components/Login.js` (guide → `/dashboard`, tourist → `/` after login)
- `client/src/components/Register.js` (same, after register)
- `client/src/index.css` (~190 lines added for dashboard styling)

### Tests run (against live server on port 5000)

| # | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `GET /api/guides/me` as guide, no profile yet | 200 with user fields + null profile fields | ✅ |
| 2 | `PUT /api/guides/me` with full payload | 200, row inserted | ✅ returned saved data |
| 3 | `GET /api/guides/me` after PUT | 200, same saved data | ✅ persistence confirmed |
| 4 | `GET /api/guides/me` as tourist | 403 `"requires role: guide"` | ✅ |
| 5 | `GET /api/guides/me` with no token | 401 `"missing token"` | ✅ |
| 6 | `GET /api/guides` (public) | 200, array of guides incl. their profiles | ✅ returns `Priya Guide` (with profile) + `Guide1` (empty profile) |

**Frontend checks**
- Client dev server recompiled cleanly after each change ("Compiled successfully!")
- `GET http://localhost:3000/dashboard` returns 200 (SPA bundle; React Router handles the component)

### Try it in the browser
1. Log in as **`priya.guide@example.com` / `guide123`**
2. You'll be redirected to [/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard)
3. Edit any field → **Save profile** → refresh the page → values persist
4. Log out, log back in as `test@example.com` / `secret123` (tourist) → you'll land on `/`, and hitting `/dashboard` directly bounces you back

### What this unlocks for the contact feature

- `guide_profiles` holds phone/rate/bio — ready to be displayed to tourists on a guide's profile page
- `requireRole('guide')` middleware is in place — use it on any guide-only endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/inquiries` for a guide's inbox)
- `requireRole('tourist')` works equally — use it on `POST /api/inquiries` so only tourists can send messages
- Suggested next tables when you build contact:
  - `conversations (id, tourist_id, guide_id, created_at)`
  - `messages (id, conversation_id, sender_id, body, created_at)`
  - `bookings (id, tourist_id, guide_id, date, hours, status, total_price)`

## Update 2 — User roles: Tourist vs. Travel Guide (2026-04-19)

Added a `role` discriminator on every user. Chosen at registration, stored in the DB, baked into the JWT, and displayed in the UI. This is the foundation for the future tourist-to-guide contact/booking flow.

### Status: ✅ Done and verified

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| DB schema | ✅ `role ENUM('tourist','guide') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'tourist'` added; existing users backfilled to `tourist` |
| Backend | ✅ Register accepts `role`, validates against allowlist, stores it; JWT payload + `/me` + register/login responses include `role` |
| Frontend | ✅ Register form has two radio cards (🧳 Tourist / 🧭 Travel Guide) |
| Navbar | ✅ Guides see a "🧭 Guide" badge next to their name; dropdown shows role label under email |
| Tests | ✅ 6/6 scenarios passing (see below) |

### What was built

**Database**
- [db/users.sql](db/users.sql) — schema updated to include the `role` column on a fresh install; migration note included as a comment for existing DBs
- Migration applied to the running MAMP DB via:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role ENUM('tourist', 'guide') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'tourist';
  ```

**Backend — [server/routes/auth.js](server/routes/auth.js)**
- `POST /api/auth/register` now accepts `{ name, email, password, role }` — `role` optional, defaults to `tourist`, rejects anything outside `['tourist', 'guide']`
- `publicUser()` and `signToken()` now include `role`
- `GET /api/auth/me` returns `role`

**Frontend**
- [client/src/context/AuthContext.js](client/src/context/AuthContext.js) — `register()` signature now takes optional `role` (defaults to `'tourist'`)
- [client/src/components/Register.js](client/src/components/Register.js) — new role selector at the top of the form (two radio cards)
- [client/src/components/Navbar.js](client/src/components/Navbar.js) — badge + role label in user menu
- [client/src/index.css](client/src/index.css) — ~80 lines added for `.role-option`, `.role-badge-guide`, `.nav-user-role`

### Tests run (against `http://localhost:5000`)

| # | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Register with `role: "guide"` | 201, user.role == "guide", JWT contains role | ✅ user id 3 created, token payload decodes to `{role: "guide"}` |
| 2 | Register with `role: "tourist"` (explicit) | 201, role stored as tourist | ✅ user id 4 |
| 3 | Register with role omitted | 201, defaults to tourist | ✅ user id 5, role = tourist |
| 4 | Register with `role: "admin"` | 400, validation error | ✅ `{"error":"role must be one of: tourist, guide"}` |
| 5 | Login as guide | 200, response includes role | ✅ |
| 6 | `GET /me` with guide token | 200, user.role == "guide" | ✅ |

**Seed guide account** (for testing the guide UI):
- Email: `priya.guide@example.com`
- Password: `guide123`

### What this unlocks for the "contact travel guide" feature

- JWT already carries `role`, so a future protected route can do `requireRole('guide')` in one line
- Frontend already knows `user.role`, so you can branch the UI (e.g., show "Message" buttons only to tourists, show an "Inbox" tab only to guides)
- Suggested next DB pieces when you build contact:
  - `guide_profiles` table: `user_id FK`, bio, languages, location, hourly_rate, verified
  - `conversations` + `messages` tables: `tourist_id`, `guide_id`, timestamps
  - `bookings` table for the eventual booking flow

## Update 1 — Register & Login (2026-04-19)

Added user authentication (register, login, session persistence) with JWT + bcrypt. All layers tested end-to-end.

---

## Status: ✅ Done and verified

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Database schema | ✅ `users` table created in MAMP `travel_guide` |
| Backend endpoints | ✅ 3 endpoints live on port 5000 |
| Frontend pages | ✅ `/login` and `/register` routes render |
| Navbar integration | ✅ Shows "Log in / Sign up" → switches to avatar + name + logout after auth |
| Session persistence | ✅ JWT saved in `localStorage`, survives page reload |
| Security | ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds), tokens signed with JWT_SECRET (7-day expiry) |
| CSS styling | ✅ Dark-themed auth cards + navbar user menu |
| End-to-end tests | ✅ 7/7 passing (see "Tests run" below) |

---

## What was built

### Database
- **[db/users.sql](db/users.sql)** — new migration file
- Table `users` (id, name, email UNIQUE, password_hash, created_at)
- Executed against MAMP MySQL

### Backend — [server/routes/auth.js](server/routes/auth.js)

| Method | Endpoint | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | `{name, email, password}` | `201 {token, user}` — 400 on validation, 409 if email taken |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | `{email, password}` | `200 {token, user}` — 401 on bad creds |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | — (Bearer token header) | `200 {user}` — 401 if missing/invalid token |

- Mounted at `/api/auth` in [server/index.js](server/index.js)
- Password hashing: `bcryptjs` (10 salt rounds)
- Tokens: `jsonwebtoken`, HS256, 7-day expiry
- `requireAuth` middleware exported for protecting future routes
- Email normalized to lowercase before storage and lookup
- Password minimum 6 characters enforced on register

### Backend config
- **[server/.env](server/.env)** — added `JWT_SECRET` (96-char random hex, generated locally, not committed)
- **[server/.env.example](server/.env.example)** — placeholder `JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-hex-string`
- New deps in [server/package.json](server/package.json): `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`

### Frontend — auth context + pages
- **[client/src/context/AuthContext.js](client/src/context/AuthContext.js)** — `AuthProvider` + `useAuth()` hook
  - State: `user`, `token`, `isAuthenticated`, `loading`
  - Methods: `login(email, password)`, `register(name, email, password)`, `logout()`
  - Persistence: `localStorage` under key `travelwire_auth`
- **[client/src/components/Login.js](client/src/components/Login.js)** — `/login` route
- **[client/src/components/Register.js](client/src/components/Register.js)** — `/register` route with password + confirm-password validation
- **[client/src/App.js](client/src/App.js)** — wraps app in `<AuthProvider>`, adds two routes
- **[client/src/components/Navbar.js](client/src/components/Navbar.js)** — logged-out shows "Log in" + "Sign up" CTA; logged-in shows avatar (initials) + name + dropdown with email + logout
- **[client/src/index.css](client/src/index.css)** — added ~200 lines of auth styling (auth cards, form inputs, user menu, CTA button)

### Brand fix (bonus)
- **[client/public/index.html:6](client/public/index.html#L6)** — meta description updated from "Wanderlust" → "Travel Wire" (the last remaining occurrence)

---

## Tests run

All against the live server on `http://localhost:5000`.

| # | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `POST /api/auth/register` with new user | 201 + token + user | ✅ Returned JWT + user `{id:1, name:"Test User", email:"test@example.com"}` |
| 2 | `POST /api/auth/register` with short password (`abc`) | 400 | ✅ `{"error":"password must be at least 6 characters"}` |
| 3 | `POST /api/auth/register` with duplicate email | 409 | ✅ `{"error":"email is already registered"}` |
| 4 | `POST /api/auth/login` with correct creds | 200 + token | ✅ Returned fresh JWT |
| 5 | `POST /api/auth/login` with wrong password | 401 | ✅ `{"error":"invalid email or password"}` |
| 6 | `GET /api/auth/me` with valid Bearer token | 200 + user | ✅ Returned user object |
| 7 | `GET /api/auth/me` without token | 401 | ✅ `{"error":"missing token"}` |

**Frontend checks**
- Client dev server (port 3000) recompiled cleanly after every file change ("Compiled successfully!")
- `/login` and `/register` return `200` with the SPA bundle (React Router handles rendering)
- Meta description in served HTML confirmed as "Travel Wire"

**Seed test user** (left in DB so you can log in immediately):
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `secret123`

---

## How to try it in the browser

1. Server on **http://localhost:5000** — already running
2. Client on **http://localhost:3000** — already running
3. Visit **http://localhost:3000** → click **Sign up** in the top-right
4. Register a new account OR log in with the seed credentials above
5. After auth, the navbar shows your avatar + name; click it for the logout menu
6. Reload the page — you stay logged in (token persists in `localStorage`)

---

## Known limitations (not in this scope)

- No "forgot password" / password reset flow
- No email verification
- No rate limiting on login (brute-force protection)
- Reviews are still anonymous — auth is not yet required to post a review (easy next step: pass the token to `POST /api/reviews` and auto-fill `author` from `req.user`)
- No protected routes on the frontend yet (every page is still public)
- No user profile page
